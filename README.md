# AI Autonomous Parking

## Summary

This project served as the thesis for my studies at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Departmen of the University of Patras. It consists of a parking game written in Python (using the Pygame library), where the player is tasked with parking a car in a randomly assigned parking spot, using the arrow keys. AI agents were trained to play the game, using OpenAI's Gymnasium and Stable-Baselines3 libraries. The following algorithms -which belong to the **Machine Learning** subcategory called **Reinforcement Learning**- were used: **Q-learning**, Proximal Policy Optimization (**PPO**), Soft Actor Critic (**SAC**), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (**DDPG**) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (**TD3**).

The final results were very promising, as the agents' in-game performance closely approached human levels of play. For example, here you can see the TD3 agent's evolution during training:

Finally, I analyzed and compared these algorithms based on training time and final performance.
