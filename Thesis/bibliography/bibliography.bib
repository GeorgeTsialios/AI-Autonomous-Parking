  abstract  = {Nowadays, native mobile applications (mobile apps) are targeted at specific mobile platforms. This phenomenon imposes severe constraints, such as the use of different development environments, technologies, and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for each mobile platform, leading inevitably to a waste of development time and effort, and an increased maintenance cost.The paper focuses on the current trends in developing cross-platform mobile apps. Our analysis focuses primarily on three areas. In the first place, we clarify the cross-platform development landscape by exploring the most important cross-platform app types, which are web, hybrid, interpreted and generated apps. Secondly, key issues for each app type are presented and a comparative analysis is performed to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each type. Thirdly, taking into account the current status in cross-platform mobile app development we identify a promising cross-platform app type and we investigate its effectiveness in practice. Finally, we draw some conclusions regarding cross-platform mobile app development approaches and make proposals for further research on the field.},

  abstract  = {We illustrate our experience, gained over years of involvement in multiple research and commercial projects, in developing accessible mobile apps with cross-platform development frameworks (CPDF). These frameworks allow the developers to write the app code only once and run it on both iOS and Android. However, they have limited support for accessibility features, in particular for what concerns the interaction with the system screen reader. To study the coverage of accessibility features in CPDFs, we first systematically analyze screen reader APIs available in native iOS and Android, and we examine whether and at what level the same functionalities are available in two popular CPDF: Xamarin and React Native. This analysis unveils that there are many functionalities shared between native iOS and Android APIs, but most of them are not available neither in React Native nor in Xamarin. In particular, not even all basic APIs are exposed by the examined CPDF. Accessing the unavailable APIs is still possible, but it requires additional effort by the developers who need to write platform-specific code in native APIs, hence partially negating the advantages of CPDF. To address this problem, we consider a representative set of native APIs that cannot be directly accessed from React Native and Xamarin and we report challenges encountered in accessing them.},

    abstract = {Abstract Background In order to promote the health of nurses while maintaining performance and patient care safety standards, better research bases on the association of work organization with health are needed. Methods Work schedule components (shift, shift length, weekends, and overtime) in a nationally representative sample of employed registered nurses participating in an anonymous mailed survey (n = 3,917) were examined in relation to past year alcohol, smoking and drug use. Results Schedule components examined separately showed modest associations with substance use. Combinations of shift and shift length interacted in association with substance use, so that nurses working night shifts >8 hr had the highest likelihood of alcohol use and smoking and those working rotating shifts >8 hr were more likely to report alcohol use. Among women, the likelihood of substance use under adverse conditions varied by family/home demands. Conclusions Administrative attention to the interplay of work schedules on workers along with consideration of competing family/home demands could lead to more healthful scheduling. In addition to substance use, working longer night and rotating shifts might be related to other health behaviors and conditions that should be examined in the future. Am. J. Ind.

The master problem finds a configuration of individual schedules to satisfy the demand coverage constraints while minimizing salary costs and maximizing both employee preferences and team balance. A feasible solution of the auxiliary problem is an acceptable schedule for a given nurse, with respect to collective agreement requirements such as seniority, workload, rotations and days off. We define a new resource structure in the auxiliary problem in order to take into account the complex collective agreement rules specific to the nurse scheduling problem. This model generalizes further the previous formulations discussed in the literature and can be viewed as a general scheme for complex personnel scheduling problems, especially in the context of organizations which operate around the clock. Solution methods and preliminary test results are discussed.}

Although GAs have been successfully used for similar problems in the past, they always had to overcome the limitations of the classical GAs paradigm in handling the conflict between objectives and constraints. The approach taken here is to use an indirect coding based on permutations of the nurses, and a heuristic decoder that builds schedules from these permutations. Computational experiments based on 52 weeks of live data are used to evaluate three different decoders with varying levels of intelligence, and four well-known crossover operators. Results are further enhanced by introducing a hybrid crossover operator and by making use of simple bounds to reduce the size of the solution space. The results reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to find high quality solutions and is both faster and more flexible than a recently published Tabu Search approach.}

  abstract = {In this paper, a detailed model and an efficient solution methodology for the monthly workshift and rest assignment of hospital nursing personnel is presented. A model that satisfies the rules of a typical hospital environment based both on published research data and on local hospital requirements is designed. A hybrid methodology that utilizes the strengths of operations research and artificial intelligence was used for the solution of the problem. In particular, an approximate integer linear programming (ILP) model is firstly solved and its solution is further improved using local search techniques. Finally, a tabu search strategy that uses as its neighborhood the solution space that the local heuristics define is presented. The use of heuristics is required because one of the main user requirements involving the user preference for specific workstretch patterns is not, for efficiency reasons, explicitly modeled in the ILP. In addition, for comparison and evaluation purposes the CLP based ILOG solver is also used to solve the same problem. The inferior computational results obtained with the ILOG solver do verify the speed and efficiency of the hybrid solution approach suggested in this paper. Extensive computational results are presented together with a detailed discussion on the quality, the computational efficiency and the operational acceptability of the solutions.}

  abstract  = {This book introduces a customer-centered approach to business by showing how data gathered from people while they work can drive the definition of a product or process while supporting the needs of teams and their organizations. This is a practical, hands-on guide for anyone trying to design systems that reflect the way customers want to do their work. The authors developed Contextual Design, the method discussed here, through their work with teams struggling to design products and internal systems. In this book, you'll find the underlying principles of the method and how to apply them to different problems, constraints, and organizational situations. Contextual Design enables you to + gather detailed data about how people work and use systems + develop a coherent picture of a whole customer population + generate systems designs from a knowledge of customer work + diagram a set of existing systems, showing their relationships, inconsistencies, redundancies, and omissions Table of Contents Chapter 1 Introduction Chapter 2 Gathering Customer Data Chapter 3 Principles of Contextual Inquiry Chapter 4 Contextual Inquiry in Practice Chapter 5 A Language of Work Chapter 6 Work Models Chapter 7 The Interpretation Session Chapter 8 Consolidation Chapter 9 Creating One View of the Customer Chapter 10 Communicating to the Organization Chapter 11 Work Redesign Chapter 12 Using Data to Drive Design Chapter 13 Design from Data Chapter 14 System Design Chapter 15 The User Environment Design Chapter 16 Project Planning and Strategy Chapter 17 Prototyping as a Design Tool Chapter 18 From Structure to User Interface Chapter 19 Iterating with a Prototype Chapter 20 Putting It into Practice}

abstract = {The growing popularity of gaming applications and ever-faster mobile carrier networks have called attention to an intriguing issue that is closely related to command input performance. A challenging mirroring game service, which simultaneously provides game service to both PC and mobile phone users, allows them to play games against each other with very different control interfaces. Thus, for efficient mobile game design, it is essential to apply a new predictive model for measuring how potential touch input compares to the PC interfaces. The present study empirically tests the keystroke-level model (KLM) for predicting the time performance of basic interaction controls on the touch-sensitive smartphone interface (i.e., tapping, pointing, dragging, and flicking). A modified KLM, tentatively called the fingerstroke-level model (FLM), is proposed using time estimates on regression models.}
